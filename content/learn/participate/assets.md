title: Licensing non-software assets

Free software licenses are most suitable for licensing, well, software. However,
free software projects often incorporate media which is not software in and of
itself, such as artwork and documentation. Different licenses are recommended
for these use-cases. We have some recommendations for licenses which are
suitable for non-software media, are within the spirit of free software, and
are compatible with free software licenses.

## Creative Commons

Most multimedia assets -- images, audio, videos, writing, and so on -- are
suitable for use with [Creative Commons][0] licenses, which include configurable
options for traits such as copyleft and attribution. Note, however, that the -ND
(no derivatives) and -NC (non-commercial) variants of Creative Commons licenses
are incompatible with free software, and the use of these assets will limit the
utility of your project within the free software ecosystem.

## Open Data Commons

Databases can be licensed under the Open Database License. The most prominent
project using it is OpenStreetMap -- which in 2012 underwent a move from CC&nbsp;BY-SA.
The new license was needed in part because in certain jurisdictions, databases
may have additional protections in parallel to (or instead of) copyright.

Similarly to Creative Commons, [Open Data Commons][odc] publishes a collection
of licenses designed for different needs: copyleft, attribution and public
domain dedication.

## Hardware

Hardware projects (schematics, HDL sources, etc.) are encouraged to use the
<a href="https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home" class="non-free" title="This link will take you to a non-free website">CERN Open Hardware License</a>.
It comes in several variants: strongly and weakly reciprocal, as well as permissive.

## Fonts

The
<a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL" class="non-free" title="This link will take you to a non-free website">SIL Open Font License</a>
is recommended for distributing fonts in a manner compatible with free software.

## Documentation

Most projects don't use a special license for their documentation. However,
the [GNU Free Documentation License][fdl] is occasionally used for this
purpose.
