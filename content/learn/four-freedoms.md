Let's examine each of the four freedoms in more detail.

## 0: Use the software

The first freedom guarantees the right for everyone to **use** the software for
any purpose. You are entitled to the use of any free software for any reason,
including commercial use -- counter-intuitively, you can sell free software. You
can also incorporate free software into your own work, but be careful -- there
are some gotchas here, which we cover under [use & reuse](/learn/use/).

In free software lingo, this is often called the "non-discrimination" clause.

## 1: Study and improve the software

The second freedom guarantees the right to **study** the program's behavior. You
have a right to understand how the software you depend on works! In order to
facilitate this, the *source code* of free software must be published. The
publishers of free software cannot obfuscate the source code, forbid reverse
engineering, or otherwise prevent you from making use of it.

Moreover, you have a right to **improve** the source code. You are not only
given the right to read the source code of free software, but also to change it
to better suit your needs.

## 2: Share the software

The third freedom guarantees the right to **share** free software with others.
If you have a copy of some free software, you can give it to your friends, or
publish it on your website, or bundle it with other software and share it as
part of something bigger. You can also share your improvements to it -- then
it's better for everyone!

## 3: Collaborate on the software

The fourth freedom guarantees one additional right: the right to **collaborate**
with others on improving the software. You can study, improve, and share the
source code, and the people you share it with can study, improve, and share it
right back with you. This is the foundation of the **Free Software Movement**: a
global community of software enthusiasts sharing and improving software
together.
