Any software is considered free software so long as it upholds the *four
essential freedoms*:

<ol start="0">
  <li>
    The freedom to <strong>use</strong> the software for any purpose.
  </li>
  <li>
    The freedom to <strong>study</strong> and <strong>improve</strong> the
    software.
  </li>
  <li>
    The freedom to <strong>share</strong> the software.
  </li>
  <li>
    The freedom to <strong>collaborate</strong> on the software.
  </li>
</ol>

Software which upholds these freedoms is **free software**. Software which does
not is **non-free**.
